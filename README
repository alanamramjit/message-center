What works:
-Most basic functionality works. Here are the commands that are implemented:
--message <user> <text>
--broadcast <message> //sends to all users
--login, including time out and presence notification sent to all online users
--logout, including a notification that user logged out to all users
--block <user>
--unblock <user>
--private message <user>
--online (see whose online)
--message forwarding

Example use:
-Run "make" in directory
-start an instance of server with $java Server <portnumber>
-start as many instances of clients with $java Client <ServerIP> <ServerPort>
-clients can log in with any user in credentials.txt; 4th failed attempt at logging in will result in timeout
-any messages sent while not logged in will be printed upon log in
